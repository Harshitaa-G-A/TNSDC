Plant_Disease_Classification

The dataset is taken from kaggle and the link for the dataset is given:
[https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rashikrahmanpritom/plant-disease-recognition-dataset] 
This dataset contains three labels, "Healthy", "Powdery", "Rust" referring to plant conditions. There is a total of 1530 images divided into train, test, and validation sets.

The project focuses on leveraging deep learning techniques for plant disease classification, aiming to assist farmers and agricultural experts in early disease detection and management. By harnessing the power of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and image processing algorithms, this system can accurately identify various diseases affecting crops based on images of plant leaves.
The plant disease classification system utilizes a curated dataset and ResNet-34(is a CNN) model with pretrained weights for accurate disease detection. Managed by the Trainer class, training is streamlined for iterative model refinement. Dynamic optimizer selection and scheduler configuration enable tailored training parameters, while integrated logging provides comprehensive insights into training metrics for informed decision-making. This system enhances crop health management for sustainable agriculture.

**Rusts**
Rusts are plant diseases caused by pathogenic fungi of the order Pucciniales. Rusts get their name because they are most commonly observed as deposits of powdery rust-coloured or brown spores on plant surfaces. The Roman agricultural festival Robigalia (April 25) has ancient origins in combating wheat rust.

**Powdery**
Powdery mildew is a fungal disease that affects a wide range of plants. Powdery mildew diseases are caused by many different species of fungi in the order Erysiphales. Powdery mildew is one of the easier plant diseases to identify, as its symptoms are quite distinctive. Infected plants display white powdery spots on the leaves and stems. The lower leaves are the most affected, but the mildew can appear on any above-ground part of the plant. As the disease progresses, the spots get larger and denser as large numbers of asexual spores are formed, and the mildew may spread up and down the length of the plant.
